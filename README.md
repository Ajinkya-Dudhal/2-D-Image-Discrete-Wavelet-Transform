# 2-D-Image-Discrete-Wavelet-Transform
Generalized Python code for 2-D image Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) without in-built function is here.

2-D DWT
1. Take ‘sample_image.jpeg’ as input.
2. Decompose it with two level decomposition levels.
3. Show the LL, LH, HL and HH (approximate, vertical, horizontal and diagonal)
    decomposition of input image.
